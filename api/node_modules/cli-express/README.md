# Express CLI

A tool to improve your Express.js development experience.

## Installation

```bash
npm install -g cli-express
```

## Description
Express CLI is a command-line tool designed to enhance your development experience with Express.js. With this tool, you can:

- Quickly configure the structure of your Express.js project
- Automatically generate models, controllers, and routes
- Customize your project configuration

### Main commands

1. Configure the project:
   ```bash
   express config
   ```
   This command allows you to configure the paths and folder names for your models, controllers, and routes.

2. Generate resources:
   ```bash
   express generate <resource>
   ```
   Where `<resource>` can be 'all', 'model', 'controller', or 'route'. This command generates the necessary files for the specified resource.

3. Initialize the project:
   ```bash
   express init
   ```
   This command initializes your Express.js project with the basic structure.

Express CLI simplifies the development process, allowing you to focus on your application logic instead of initial configuration and repetitive file creation.

### Usage Examples

1. Initialize a new project:
   ```bash
   express init
   ```

2. Configure folder paths:
   ```bash
   express config
   ```

3. Generate a new model:
   ```bash
   express generate model
   ```

4. Generate a controller and a route for an existing resource:
   ```bash
   express generate all
   ```

These commands will help you structure and develop your Express.js project more efficiently.
